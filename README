Data::Printer::Filter::EscapeNonPrintable

This module is a filter plugin for Data::Printer.

Rationale:

    Since DDP does not escape all ASCII control chars in print_escapes, this
    filter escapes them to octal notation. Vertical tab ("\x0b") and DEL ("\x7f")
    chars are also missed, thus escaped.

    All the missing chars are colorized to their "escaped" color theme.

    Note that this is a hack; the proper way to fix this should be to patch DDP.
